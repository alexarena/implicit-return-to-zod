A POC exploration in...

- Extracting a type definition from a function without an explicit return type annotation
- Using that type definition to generate a Zod schema

Potential applications:

- Varied :)

Usage:

- `npm i`
- `npm run generate`

A `test-file.zod.ts` file should be generated in the `demo/out` directory.
